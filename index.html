            <H3>Final video of the old channel.</H3>
            <small>Posted by Ghott0 on Mar 25</small>
            <p>The final video of my youtube channel, which was started in my childhood.
                it is an uncerimonial but also borderline sentimental video, because of it's meaning.
                it is truly the end of a chapter, but the start of another.

            <h3>The DMC car meet with the aeroknots</h3>
            <small>Posted by Ghott0 on Mar 24</small>
            <p>My friend Jownz scheduled a birthday meet on March 24th. The car meet had the presence of the
                aeroknots, a world-famous air show crew. the aeroknots put on a 25-minute-long superb performance
                with all kinds of aerobatics imaginable. It was a very emotional meet, since it was the first
                one after a 2-year hiatus. We got to reflect on the sheer impact that the community has had
                in our lives.
